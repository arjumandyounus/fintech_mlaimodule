# FinTech ML & AI Module Text Analytics Project

The purpose of this project is to assess how textual analytics of news articles related to a company
can relate/not relate to its key performance indicators (KPIs). Our chosen company is Tesla, and
sentiment analysis is the dominant text mining method we will take a look into.
The following files constitute a part of this project:
1) News article files for 14 days of which the files themselves are named news_1.txt, news_2.txt up
til news_30.txt and the csv file sentiment_newsarticles.csv contains a sentiment for each article
except the last 3 days as they serve as our test set.
2) The file Tesla_KPI.csv contains information about the company Tesla and key performance
indicators mainly return on equity and net profit margin for each of the 14 days in our sample.
3) The files postivewords.txt and negativewords.txt contain respectively a list of positive and
negative words for the finance domain.
Your analysis needs to be made up of the following steps:

1) News articles for the last three days do not have a sentiment assigned; use the Naive Bayes
algorithm of scikit-learn discussed in class on 22 nd November, 2021 to assign a sentiment to these
articles.
2) Within files positivewords.txt and negativewords.txt are sets of positive and negative words for
finance domain. For each article compute the proportion of postive words and proportion of
negative words as follows:


      <div aign="center">
            <strong>Proportion of positive words = Number of positive words from list/Total number of unique words</strong>
      </div>
<div align="center">
            <strong>Proportion of negative words = Number of negative words from list/Total number of unique words</strong>
</div>
Use these proportions as features for prediction of companyâ€™s performance on the basis of return on
equity and net profit margin as follows:
(return on equity > 0.6 and net profit margin > 0.4) or return on equity>0.8
then performance is good
(return on equity <= 0.6 and net profit margin <= 0.4) or return on equity<0.2
then performance is bad
For the prediction part of the assignment, it is mandatory to use sentiment assigned (already given
for first 11 days and predicted for last 3 days as part of Q(1) above), proportion of positive words
and proportion of negative words as features. Use two algorithms namely logistic regression and
random forests for the prediction part; use first 11 days as trainin set and last 3 days as test set. You
are free to be creative and add more features such as proportion of adjectives (which can be done
using nltk).
